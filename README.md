# Subreddit-Interactions-NetworkX-Analysis

This project presents a network analysis of inter-
actions between popular subreddits on the Red-
dit platform. The data was extracted using web
scraping techniques, and formed a directed net-
work graph using NetworkX in Python. The graph
was analyzed and visualized using a combination
of Gephi and NetworkX. The results show that
subreddits with similar topics tend to be very heav-
ily connected, whereas subreddits with dissimilar
topics have loose connections that represent the
wide-ranging interests of the population. Certain
subreddits act as important hubs that facilitate
interactions between dierent communities. The
network graph’s global characteristics, important
nodes, distribution graphs, resilience against tar-
geted/random attacks, and implications for spread-
ing models are discussed. It can be conclusively
determined that the Reddit platform’s structure
is scale-free, and subreddits play an essential role
in shaping communication and information ow
across the platform.
