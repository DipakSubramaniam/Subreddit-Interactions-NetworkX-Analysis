# Subreddit-Interactions-NetworkX-Analysis

This project presents a network analysis of interactions between popular subreddits on the Reddit platform. The data was extracted using web scraping techniques, and formed a directed network graph using NetworkX in Python. The graph was analyzed and visualized using a combination of Gephi and NetworkX. The results show that subreddits with similar topics tend to be very heavily connected, whereas subreddits with dissimilar topics have loose connections that represent the wide-ranging interests of the population. Certain subreddits act as important hubs that facilitate interactions between different communities. The network graph’s global characteristics, important nodes, distribution graphs, resilience against targeted/random attacks, and implications for spreading models are discussed. It can be conclusively determined that the Reddit platform’s structure is scale-free, and subreddits play an essential role in shaping communication and information flow across the platform.
